<h3 class="overview">Overview.</h3>
<p> Cyber Kids Go is an engaging, online, multilevel-gaming-platform aimed at children ages eight to thirteen years old, providing children with the capacity to recognise and protect themselves from online dangers. Marketed as a subscription software aimed at home and primary schools, it's aim is to equip children to understand and mitigate threats they encounter online within an age-specific curriculum. This software aims to enable teachers to feel confident engaging children in online activities and students to build digital awareness and resilience. Cyber Kids Go is an important platform for the safety of children that provides an essential learning environment addressing topics like cyberbullying, inappropriate content, online predators, phishing, scams, digital health to personal privacy, among other significant topics in an age-appropriate manner. Two obstacles will be the consideration of the sensitive topics with children and complying with regulations and law.  </p>

  There is a pressing need for this esafety software. Studies have shown that second-generation digital natives are more digitally engaged and higher users of the internet than any previous generation (Joiner et al. 2016). This level of interaction leaves these children vulnerable to many online threats. Jadambaa et al. (2019) found that a significant problem amongst adolescents is the prevalence of bullying. They recommend programs to be funded and implemented within schools. The report: Online Child Sexual Exploitation: Understanding community awareness, perceptions, Attitudes and preventative behaviours, brings to light that, over half of the caregivers surveyed felt they were unequipped to maintain their child’s safety online from sexual exploitation (Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation 2020). In an interview with Australia’s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman – Grant,  ‘Welcome back. Your kids might be more internet savvy than you, so we asked you to send your questions for Australia's eSafety Commissioner’ (2019) she states occurrence of sextortion within gaming sites, is increasing in Australia and one in five youth have experienced harassment within the gaming arena. This suggests that as children’s online presence increases, so does the need for education around these technologies and vulnerabilities.

<h3 class="description">Description.</h3>
<p>
  Filling this need for online safety awareness and education by tuning into the popularity of online gaming, Cyber Kids Go will equip children and educators alike. An official report by the Office of the eSafety Commissioner (2018) informs us that the employment of online gaming amongst Australia’s youth is as high as six in ten children and, of those, half have played with strangers. Cyber Kids Go is a safe platform that will address: cyber-bullying, inappropriate content, online pornography, digital health, predators and grooming, sextortion, phishing, scams, personal privacy, permanence, social media, advertising, data safety, dangerous links, password safety, streaming content and any materialising threats as new technologies emerge. </p>
  <P>
    When Children begin the program in year three, they start with issues that affect them, beginning with safety concepts. As they grow and develop their online usage and awareness, the program evolves with appropriate content in an age-related level system. By the age of twelve, they have crucial knowledge of social media in addition to the responsibilities that come with owning social media accounts, preparing them for the legal age children are allowed official access to social media sites. Sites like Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and set the minimum age for owning an account to thirteen years. Despite this 51% of Australian children aged eight to eleven are using social media before the recommended age, as stated in Click and Connect: Young Australians’ use of online social media (2020). </p>
      <p>
        Cyber Kids Go will evolve as culture and technologies evolve, making sure to equip kids before dangers become presented to them. Kids will remain engaged with a reward system and modern game style customisable avatars and collectables. Backgrounds and interactions mature as children age, matching, sorting and trivia games become increasingly challenging and informative with more sensitive topics as children grow. The site will include a library of content, including videos, quizzes and worksheets, that are accessible at any time and interactive lesson plans for educators. Cyber Kids Go utilises instant reports for teachers and parents and well as reports for home educators, helping parents and schools to have an appraisal of the student's online intelligence. Another key feature of this software will be the ability for kids to access counselling and legal resources. The platform will contain a page with links to helpful resources to manage online issues. One of these resources will be the Kid’s Helpline online chat function where users can quickly access online counselling regarding any online issues. A password-protected parent portal will be available for carers and parents to have access to links and information regarding reporting cyber-crime, abuse and counselling services.

<h3 class="toolss">Tools & Technologies.</h3>
<p>
  The tools needed for this project include some open source and some costed elements. This project can utilise Atom for writing code, Bootstrap for code library, Git or GitHub for collaboration and testing of code. Utilising an online game building platform like Unity or Construct 3 for world-building and Cocos2D to build 2D maps. WordPress for front end consumer access and marketing. Platform as a service (PLAS) from Azure or AWS. Social media platforms for market and email and MS Teams for communication. The office suite will be useful as business tools. These will be beneficial tools to learn.
</p>
<br />
<h3 class="skills">Skills Required.</h3>
<p>
  The content must be designed with restricted access per user. The skills needed are graphic and content design, programming to develop the platform, the ability to use WordPress, Atom, GitHub, the PLAS and application program interfaces (APIs) for software interaction. Developing the software will see the use of HTML, CSS and Java. The use of C# could be helpful in the future. On top of this marketing, business skills and curriculum development will be imperative. These skillsets are all able to be sourced within Australia and, the probability of grants and funding from the government is likely, making this project plausible.
</p>
<br />
<h3 class="outcome" >Outcome.</h3>
<p>
  If successful, Cyber Kids Go will be implemented in primary schools and homes across Australia, creating widespread reach. This program will fundamentally change attitudes of complacency and fear toward the digital life of eight to thirteen-year-old children in Australia and empower children to recognise and mitigate threats to their online safety. Through this fun, engaging and informative platform, children will build online resilience and carers will gain confidence in the safety of their student’s online interactions. Cyber Kids Go can help mitigate the prevalence of sextortion, abuse, phishing, scams and bullying-related mental health issues amongst youth.
